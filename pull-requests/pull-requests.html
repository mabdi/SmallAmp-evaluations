<h2 id="bloc">Bloc</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/feenkcom/Bloc/pull/7">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a new assertion in an existing test method in the test class <code>BlKeyboardProcessorTest</code>. The suggested test method is shown in figure below.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>By calling the state revealer method <code>#keystrokesAllowed</code>, this assertion verifies the correctness of the object state after an <code>#processKeyDown:</code> event.</p>
<p>The pull-request was also merged after a few weeks with a positive comment.</p>
<h2 id="dataframe">DataFrame</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/DataFrame/pull/132">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a new test method in the test class <code>DataFrameTest</code>. The suggested test method is shown in the figure below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/pr-dataframe.png" alt="A new test method suggestion sent in a pull-request to the project DataFrame" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">A new test method suggestion sent in a pull-request to the project DataFrame</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The variable <code>df</code> is an instance variable that has been initialized in the <code>#setUp</code> method. It includes a tabular data mixed from numbers and texts.</p>
<p>This test method makes it explicit that calling the method <code>#range</code> on a DataFrame object containing non-numerical columns throws an exception. With this new test it becomes an explicit part of the contract for DataFrame.</p>
<p>The pull-request was merged after a few weeks. A developer of the project commented: <em>Small-amp seems to be a very valuable tool!</em></p>
<h2 id="discordst">DiscordSt</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/JurajKubelka/DiscordSt/pull/75">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a new test method in the test class <code>DSEmbedImageTest</code>. The suggested test method is shown in figure below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/pr-discordst.png" alt="A new assertion in test method suggestion sent in a pull-request to the project DiscordSt" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">A new assertion in test method suggestion sent in a pull-request to the project DiscordSt</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The method covers the method <code>#extent</code> which was not covered in the test class before. The pull-request was merged after a few days.</p>
<h2 id="graphql">GraphQL</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/OBJECTSEMANTICS/GraphQL/pull/12">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a new test method in the test class <code>GQLSSchemaNodeTest</code>. The suggested test method is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>This test method verifies the return value of <code>directives</code> in a <code>schema</code> object. The returned value is generated in the method <code>GQLSSchemaNode $&gt;$$&gt;$ initializeDefaultDirectives</code> and contains technical debt. This test method guards against future evolutions which may break assumptions made by clients.</p>
<p>The pull-request was merged after a few days.</p>
<h2 id="materialdesignlite">MaterialDesignLite</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/DuneSt/MaterialDesignLite/pull/308">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding two new test methods in the test class <code>MDLCalendarTest</code>. The suggested test methods are shown in figures below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/pr-materialdesignlite1.png" alt="A new assertion in test method suggestion sent in a pull-request to the project MaterialDesignLite" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">A new assertion in test method suggestion sent in a pull-request to the project MaterialDesignLite</figcaption>

</figure>
<p>Both of test methods are similar and are created by adding a new method call to the test input. The tests are created for the <code>Calendar</code> widget and verify correctness of <code>#selectPreviousYears</code> and <code>#selectNextYears</code> methods.</p>
<p>The pull-request was merged the day after.</p>
<h2 id="openponk">OpenPonk</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/OpenPonk/openponk">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a set of new lines in an existing test method in the test class <code>OPDiagramTest</code>. The suggested test method is shown in the figure below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/pr-openponk.png" alt="Changes on an existing test method sent in a pull-request to the project OpenPonk" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Changes on an existing test method sent in a pull-request to the project OpenPonk</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The assertions in lines 104 to 107 verify the state of a freshly initialized <code>OPDiagram</code> object (where model is <code>nil</code>). Then the model has been set to an appropriate value. The assertions in lines 109 to 112 verify the public API through the accessor methods.</p>
<p>The pull-request is not merged up to the date of writing this paper.</p>
<h2 id="petitparser2">PetitParser2</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/kursjan/petitparser2">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a new test method in the test class <code>PP2NoopVisitorTest</code>. The suggested test method is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>The test method tests the value of <code>currentContext</code> in <code>result</code> object. The pull-request is not merged up to the date of writing this paper.</p>
<h2 id="pharo-launcher">Pharo-Launcher</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-launcher/pull/500">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a new test method in the test class <code>PhLImportImageCommandTest</code>. The suggested test method is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>This test is produced from the original test method of <code>testCanImportAnImage</code> which verifies an image can be imported using a valid filename. SmallAmp applies a literal mutation on the file name (<code>'foo.image'</code> changed to <code>'fo.image'</code>) that results an invalid filename and consequently raising a <code>FileDoesNotExistException</code> error. Before sending the pull-request, we selected meaningful names for the name of the test method and the file.</p>
<p>The pull-request was merged in the same day with this comment: <em>Indeed, the test you are adding has a value. Good job SmallAmp</em>.</p>
<h2 id="polymath">PolyMath</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/PolyMath/pull/178">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a new test method in the test class <code>PMVectorTest</code>. The suggested test method is shown in the figure below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/pr-polymath.png" alt="A new test method suggestion sent in a pull-request to the project PolyMath" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">A new test method suggestion sent in a pull-request to the project PolyMath</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This test method is testing the call of the method <code>#householder</code> on two different vectors. Before this test, the method <code>#householder</code> was not covered in this test class.</p>
<p>The <em>method-call-adder</em> input amplifier adds calling to this method in different test methods. We included two of them in a new test method that execute two different branches in the test method (based on the condition <code>x &lt;= 0</code>). The former vector (line 75 in the figure) forces the <code>ifTrue</code> branch and the latter vector (line 80 in the figure) forces <code>ifFalse</code> branch. Note that the comment text (line 75) is added manually to increase the readability of the test.</p>
<p>The original test method included two assertions to confirm the type of the returned value of the method (<code>self assert: w class equals: Array</code>). The developers asked us to omit these assertion statements, because it was exposing an implementation detail. We changed the pull request accordingly and it was merged immediately.</p>
<h2 id="roassal3">Roassal3</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/ObjectProfile/Roassal3/pull/340">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a new test method in the test class <code>RSCameraTest</code> called <code>#testZoomToFit</code>. The suggested test method is shown in the figure below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/pr-roassal3.png" alt="Suggested test method in the project Roassal3" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Suggested test method in the project Roassal3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This test method is derived from an original test called <code>#testPosition</code>, and covers the method <code>RSCamera&gt;&gt; #zoomToFit</code>, which was not covered by <code>RSCameraTest</code>.</p>
<p>The pull-request merged with the comment: <em>Thanks! Your test makes sense</em>.</p>
<h2 id="seaside">Seaside</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/SeasideSt/Seaside/pull/1215">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a set of new lines into an existing test method in the test class <code>WARequestTest</code>. The test method and suggestions are shown in the fegure below.</p>
<figure>

<p>This new test method kills 6 new mutants. It is the result of a cooperation between <em>assertion amplification</em> and <em>input amplification</em>. Lines 5 to 10 is produced by assertion amplification on the original test method (<code>#testPostFields</code>). Line 15 is added by <em>method-call-adder</em> input-amplifier.</p>
<p>This test was merged by one of the project’s developers after a few days. Moreover, the developer left a valuable comment containing the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The suggestions do not fit this test method</strong>: The developer said <em>I expected the testPostfields unit test method to focus on testing the postFields</em>. We agree with his/her remark. If the suggested changes do not have a semantic relation to the original test method, it should be moved to another test or a new one. We considered this advice in the next pull-requests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usefulness of the result to refactoring the tests</strong>: The developer also stated <em>the result of the test amplification makes me evaluate the existing unit tests and refactor them to improve the test coverage and test factorization</em>. This shows that even if the immediate results of test amplification are not tidy enough, they still help refactor existing tests.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="telescope">Telescope</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/TelescopeSt/Telescope">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a new test method in the test class <code>TLNodeCreationStrategyTest</code>. The suggested test method is shown in figure below.</p>

<p>The test method verifies the state of the returned object from calling <code>copyAsSimpleStrategy</code>. This method is never covered in the test class. It also contain technical debt.</p>
<p>The pull-request is not merged up to the date of writing this paper.</p>
<h2 id="zinc">Zinc</h2>
<p>We sent a <a href="https://github.com/svenvc/zinc/pull/58">pull-request</a> to this project containing the suggestion for adding a new test method in the test class <code>ZnRequestTest</code>. The suggested test method is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>This test method calls the method <code>#setAcceptEncodingGzip</code> on an <code>request</code> object. Then calls another method <code>#acceptsEncodingGzip</code> to verify the change. Both of these methods were not covered in this test class before this test method.</p>
<p>This method is built by cooperating three module of SmallAmp. First, <em>method-call-adder</em> input amplifier adds a new method call. Then <em>assertion amplification</em> inserts a set of new assertions after the added method call. And finally, after the main amplification loop is finished, the <em>assertion reducer</em> rejects all superfluous assertion statements.</p>
<p>The pull-request was merged in the same day.</p>
